# YOYUNCAK C# SERVER PROGRAM LOCAL

## Playground IoT Project

It is a program that acts as a bridge between the local node-socket-io server and the cloud io server in a playground. 

Two things are aimed with this study;
- Sharing some information in the playgrounds by the toys and monitoring computers in the playground,
- Some settings and updates of PC and toys in the playgrounds can be done remotely. 
- Ensuring that all processes in the playground can be monitored instantly.

This informations could be:
- The amount of coins available on the contactless card.
- Where and when the contactless card is used.
- Customer information of the contactless card.
